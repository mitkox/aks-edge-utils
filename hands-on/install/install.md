# AKS Edge Essentials Installation 

## Lab Overview  
In this lab, you will begin by reviewing the AKS EE's deployment prerequisites and setup the machine to start the deployment. You will need to download and install the k8s or k3s installer for AKS EE, then use the deployment CLI with configuration to complete single machine deployment on Azure VM or physical machine, or multiple node cluster deployment on physical machine.   
  
In summary, the lab includes the following exercises:  
* Review the hands on Lab Prerequisites
* Install AKS EE k8s/k3s installer on each node
* Implement Single machine deployment in a Azure VM
* Extend: Implement full deployment with multiple nodes

## Lab Instructions

### Exercise 1: Setup your machine and install AKS Edge Essentials (ower: Guomin)

In this lab, we will use Azure virtual machine to do a single machince setup and deployment.

#### Step 1: Create a Azure virtual machine with WIndows 11 Pro installed.  
  
1. Sign in to Azure  
Sign in to Azure portal at: https://portal.azure.com.

2. In Azure portal, click **Create a resource**, select **Create** in the **Virtual machine** to open the **Create a virtual machine** page

3. Create the VM with below settings  

    ![Azure VM details](./imgs/az-vm-details.jpg)

* **Resource group**: your resource group name, ex: aks-edge-ee-lab-< your name >
* **Virtual machine name**: your vm name, ex: aks-edge-ee-< your name >
* **Region**: your Azure region.
* **Image**: Use the **Windows 11 Pro, version 22H2 - Gen2**
* **Size**: Use the **Stardard D4ds_v5 - 4vcpus, 16GB memory**  

    And allow inbound rules for RDP connection as below

    Select **Review + Create** button at the bottom of the page to create virtual machine.

#### STEP 2: Connect into the Windows 11 Pro virtual machine  
1. Once the virtual machine is created, go to the **Overview** page, select **Connect** then **RDP** to download the RDP file to your local machine.
2. Double click the downloaded RDP file to connect into the virtual machine.

#### STEP 3: Enable Hyper-V features for Windows

1. Open a PowerShell console as Administrator, run following command:  
    ```bash
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
    ```

2. check if Hyper-V is enabled using following command:
    ```bash
    Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName *hyper*
    ```

#### STEP 4: Install K8S or K3S in Windows 11 Pro
AKS Edge Essentials can be deployed on either a single machine or on multiple machines to form a cluster. For both cases it must install AKS on each of the machines using the installer showed [HERE](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-howto-setup-machine?branch=release-aks-lite#download-the-installer) to install K8S or K3S as its Kubernetes distribution, but for the same cluster you can only install the same Kubernetes distribution(k8s or k3s) and can't mixed.  

In this lab, we will use the K8S as Kubernetes distribution but you can deside if you want K3S, the installation steps is similar.

1. Download K8S installer  
    Downlad K8S installer from this [link](https://aka.ms/aks-edge/k8s-msi).

2. Install K8S  
    Double-click the downloaded **AksEdge-K8s-0.7.22335.1024.msi** to start installation.  

3. Verify the installation

    Running below command in Powershell to list the AksEdge module: 
    ```bash
    Get-Command -Module AksEdge
    ```

    and below command to show the AksEdge version
    ```bash
    (Get-Module AksEdge -ListAvailable).Version
    ```
Now you are already setup your machine as Linux node. 

**OPTIONAL**: If you also want to add Windows node support to the machine please take below steps:

1. Download the Windows node files from this [Link](https://aka.ms/aks-edge/windows-node-zip) and extract to a folder  
2. Open Powershell as Administrator and navigate to above folder that contains the Windows node files.
3. Running below command to start install
    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i AksEdge-k8s-0.7.22335.1024.msi ADDLOCAL=CoreFeature,WindowsNodeFeature
    ```
4. Now you are ready to do **Linux & Windows** node mixed deployment

Please **NOTE** once again, you must do above steps in each machine in your cluster to setup your machines befor making Aks Edge deployment in the next lab sections. 
  
## Execise 2: Implment single machine deployment

You can run the New-AksEdgeDeployment cmdlet to deploy a single-machine AKS Edge cluster with a single Linux control-plane node, however we need to pass ServiceIpRangeSize = 10, which is not a default option. On single machine cluster, if you deployed your Kubernetes cluster without specifying a -ServiceIPRangeSize, you will not have allocated IPs for your workload services and you won't have an external IP address. Hence we will use the JSON object and pass it as a string:

```bash
$jsonString = New-AksEdgeConfig -outFile .\mydeployconfig.json
$jsonObj = $jsonString | ConvertFrom-Json 
$jsonObj.EndUser.AcceptEula = $true
$jsonObj.EndUser.AcceptOptionalTelemetry = $true
$jsonObj.LinuxVm.CpuCount = 4
$jsonObj.LinuxVm.MemoryInMB = 8192
$jsonObj.Network.ServiceIpRangeSize = 40

New-AksEdgeDeployment -JsonConfigString ($jsonObj | ConvertTo-Json)
 ```

Confirm that the deployment was successful by running:
=======
Confirm that the deployment was successful the Mariner VM is listed with hcsdiag and the pods are running by running:

```bash 
kubectl get nodes -o wide
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
 ```

PS: Multi-node AKS on Edge on Windows will not work on Azure because it will not allow to create Hyper-V external virtual switch due to the limit of Azure network backbone, but we can create external swithch on Physical PC's Hyper-V, then it's possible to create a VM on the same Hyper-V host to communicate with the mariner VM via that external switch with the local ip in the pysical pc's local network.
